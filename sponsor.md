ICP Challenge:

I leveraged ICP to build a decentralized landing page and implement user authentication so spammers and bots are blocked from accessing our bot.

Built custom LLM trained on ICP documentation to assist me in learning about ICP and building on ICP for the first time!

I really disliked deploying on Netlify and now that I’ve learned to deploy on ICP, I can’t wait to use it for all my web deployments from now on!

Best Use of Hedera:

With FaceConnect, you are able to see your Hedera account info using your face, no need to memorize your public key or search your phone for it anymore!

Allow people to send transactions to people based on face! (Wasn’t able to get it working but I have all the prerequisites to make it work in the future - sender Hedera address, recipient Hedera address).

In the future, to pay someone or a vendor in Hedera, you can just scan their face to get their wallet address instead of preparing QR codes or copy and pasting!

I also built a custom LLM trained on Hedera documentation to assist me in learning about Hedera and building on Hedera as a beginner!

Best Use of Flow

With FaceConnect, to pay someone or a vendor in Flow, you can just scan their face to get their wallet address instead of preparing QR codes or copy and pasting!

I also built a custom LLM trained on Flow documentation to assist me in learning about Flow and building on Flow as a beginner!

Georgian AI Challenge Prize

I was inspired by the data sources listed in the document by scraping LinkedIn profile pictures and their faces for obtaining a dataset to test and verify my face recognition model!

I also built a custom LLM trained on Georgian documentation to learn more about the firm!

FaceCon.tech

Best AI Hack:

Use of AI include:
1. Used Computer Vision with OpenCV and the Dlib C++ Library to implement AI-based facial biometric encoding and recognition.
2. Leveraged ChromaDB and Llama Index to create vector embeddings of sponsor documentation
3. Utilized Langchain to implement document retrieval from VectorDBs
4. Used OpenAI to process user queries for everything Hack the Valley related!

By leveraging AI, FaceConnect has not only addressed a common real-world problem but has also pushed the boundaries of what's possible in terms of human-computer interaction. Its sophisticated AI algorithms and models enable users to connect based on visuals alone, transcending language and other barriers. This innovative use of AI in fostering human connections sets FaceConnect apart as an exceptional candidate for the "Best AI Hack" award.

Best Diversity Hack:

Our project aligns with the Diversity theme by promoting inclusivity and connection across various barriers, including language and disabilities. By enabling people to connect using facial recognition and images, our solution transcends language barriers and empowers individuals who may face challenges related to memory loss, speech, or hearing impairments. It ensures that everyone, regardless of their linguistic or physical abilities, can stay connected and engage with others, contributing to a more diverse and inclusive community where everyone's unique attributes are celebrated and connections are fostered.

Imagine trying to get someone’s contact in Germany, or Thailand, or Ethiopia? Now you can just take a picture!
