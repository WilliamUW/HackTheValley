### Best Use of Hedera:

With FaceConnect, you are able to see your Hedera account info using your face, no need to memorize your public key or search your phone for it anymore!

Allow people to send transactions to people based on face! (Wasnâ€™t able to get it working but I have all the prerequisites to make it work in the future - sender Hedera address, recipient Hedera address).

In the future, to pay someone or a vendor in Hedera, you can just scan their face to get their wallet address instead of preparing QR codes or copy and pasting!

I also built a custom LLM trained on Hedera documentation to assist me in learning about Hedera and building on Hedera as a beginner!
