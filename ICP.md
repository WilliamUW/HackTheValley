### ICP Challenge:

I leveraged ICP to build a decentralized landing page and implement user authentication so spammers and bots are blocked from accessing our bot.

Built custom LLM trained on ICP documentation to assist me in learning about ICP and building on ICP for the first time!

I really disliked deploying on Netlify and now that I’ve learned to deploy on ICP, I can’t wait to use it for all my web deployments from now on!
